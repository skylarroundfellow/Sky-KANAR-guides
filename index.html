				<p>
				A suit of armor is divided into 7 locations: 2 legs, 2
				arms, front torso, rear torso, and head. Armor points
				are given based on the number of locations armored.
				</p>
				<p>
				If a player has both upper arms (but not lower arms), or
				both lower arms (but not upper arms), they gain AP as
				if they had ONE arm location covered. If a player has
				both upper legs (but not lower legs), or both lower legs
				(but not upper legs), they gain AP as if they had ONE
				leg location covered.
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="bold">Example:</span> Samson has a plate breastplate (20), 2 plate
				legs (20x2), and 2 leather arms (5x2), for 70 total AP.

			<p>
			<strong>Knockout:</strong> With this surprise attack, a character is able
				to inflict a target with the Stunned status (see Status list).
				To simulate this attack, the attacker must tap between
				the shoulder blades of the victim with the pommel of
				the weapon while announcing “Knockout”. This action
				represents a blow to the back of the head, so a metal
				helmet that covers the back of the head will protect the
				victim from this attack. This attack may be performed
				on any humanoid-shaped figure of a height no greater
				than 10 feet. This attack doesn&apos;t inflict damage.

			<h4>Armor Types</h4>
			<p>
				There are four types of armor in Kanar: Leather,
				Composite, Chainmail/Metal Scale and Plate.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold">Leather:</span> This armor is made from the hides of animals.
				The leather is usually hardened to fit the wearer. <br>
				<span class="bold">Composite: </span>These are more advanced forms of leather
				armor. Some examples of this are studded leather,
				leather scale, and ring mail.<br>
				<span class="bold">Chain/Metal Scale:</span> Chainmail is composed of small
				metal rings interwoven to form a flexible material,
				which is shaped into hoods, vests, etc. Metal scale is
				similar to leather scale except that the scales are made
				of metal.<br>
				<span class="bold">Plate:</span> Plate armor is made of large metallic plates that
				are shaped and articulated to offer nearly complete
				protection of the entire body.
				<br><br>

				When a character wearing armor receives damage,
				that amount of damage is subtracted from the piece of
				armor with the lowest number of AP. Once that piece of
				armor has been reduced to 0 AP, damage is then applied
				to the piece of armor with the next-highest AP, and so
				on. If at any point, a piece of armor is reduced to 0, it
				is broken and must be repaired in between events by
				the appropriate crafter or on field as the crafters on
				field crafting time. Repair time and cost is half of its
				creation time and cost.

			<h2>Spell Restrictions</h2>
			An item may only have one Augment spell active on it
			at any one time A character may only have one Boon
			and one Protection spell of a single element active upon
			them at any one time For instance, they may have
			one Air Protection and one Earth Protection, or one
			Air Protection and one Air Boon, but never two Air
			Protections<br><br>
			If an item or character is successfully targeted by a spell
			of a higher level than one currently active upon them,
			and the existing effect conflicts with the new one as
			described above, the old spell ends and the new one
			takes effect For instance, if a character is currently
			under the effects of a Level 2 Water Boon, and they are
			successfully targeted by a Level 3 Water Boon, the Level
			2 spell ends and the Level 3 spell takes effect<br><br>
			Please note: Some Mass spells state that all targets in
			the area gain the effects of a lower-level spell For the
			purposes of deciding which spell ends and which one
			takes effect, the Mass spell counts as the level of the
			spell listed in the description For example, someone
			under the effects of Courage of Aeracon may be within
			the area of a Mass Greater Courage spell – that spell
			would not replace the Courage of Aeracon, since it is a
			higher level than Greater Courage<br><br>

			<h1>Out-of-Game Mechanics for Item Creation</h1>
			<p>
				<strong>Off field:</strong> All Item creation occurring between events
				is done on-line and requires the use of a player bank.
				Go to www.kanar.club and fill out the appropriate item
				creation form. Please see the crafting packets for details
				on what you can craft in between events. Once your
				creation time has been completed, the game staff will
				give you a tag for your item at the following event.<br><br>

				<strong>On field:</strong> Once per event, a character may use a Craft,
				Herbalism, or Item Creation skill to craft or refine an
				item on field. To do so, they must spend two hours
				roleplaying the process. This roleplay must involve
				Phys. Reps. for appropriate tools and materials, simply
				miming the actions with no props is insufficient.<br><br>
				One prop (such as an anvil, a sewing basket, or a small
				workbench) should be marked with yellow tape and
				placed on a flat, stationary surface (such as the ground
				or a table) at the beginning of this time. If the marked
				item is moved, if the character falls unconscious, or if
				they move more than 10’ from the item at any point,
				this time is lost and they must start over. If the char-
				acter is successful, they may see an appropriate staff
				member for a tag for one of the following: <br><br>
			</p>
				<ol>
				<li>
					One Non-Master Crafted Item which the char-
					acter could produce using their existing Craft
					skill(s), Herbalism skill, or Item Creation skills in
					one month or less. The character must still pay
					all coin and material costs for creating the item.
					If creating a potion or scroll, the crafter must
					successfully cast the spell being placed into the
					item during the roleplayed crafting time. This
					spell will be absorbed by the item upon casting
				</li>
				<li class="space">
					One Master Crafted item which the character
					could produce using their existing Level 5 Craft
					skill(s) in one month or less. The player must first
					provide a tag for an identical Non-Master Crafted
					Item, as well as any difference in coin or material
					costs between a Master Crafted and Non-Master
					Crafted item of that type.

				Hello everyone!<br>
				<br>
				The Game Master Staff and Play Master Staff have been working together to bring you the following change to lighten the burden on the new armor system.<br>
				<br>
				Armor Locations that share a singular physical representation can be merged through the Economic Staff. These merged locations would share a AP (Armor Points) pool. Meaning they would be broken together but would also mean they can be repaired together. This also means if you have 4 locations of plate merged into 1 tag they would need to take a total of 80 damage before breaking.<br>
				<br>
				This should make the new changes to the armor system easier to manage.<br>
				<br>
				We hope to see everyone again for this season, let's make it a great year!<br>
				<br>

						In general, armor provides the player with extra AP (Armor Points).  This AP is depleted first when taking damage.
						See the <a href="#Combat">Combat</a> section for a deeper dive into the mechanics.
					</p>
				<h2 id="ArmorLocations">Locations</h2>
					<p class="clickable" onclick="toggleContent('armorLocation')">
						In KANAR, armor is worn on specific locations on the body. <br>
						There are 7 in total: <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rear Torso (Back)<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Front Torso (Chest) <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left Arm<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right Arm<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left Leg<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right Leg<br>
						<br>
						The physical representation (physrep) needs to cover the majority of the location to count, but you can combine partial locations on the limbs. This means you could wear two bracers which cover both of your lower arms and count it as one location.  Or wear two greaves and count that as one as well.

						Each armor location can support only one type of armor at a time.  You can&apos;t stack breastplate and a chain shirt for your Front Torso slot.  You would need to decide which of the two filled the location. <br>

						A player must also have a tag for each location of armor for it to be considered in game.<br>

				</p>
					<table class="CenteredTable">
						<thead>

				<h2 id="CalculatingAP">Calculating AP</h2>
					<p >
						To calculate the AP of the armor you currently have equipped, you add up the current AP for each of the 7 locations.<br><br>
						In order for a location to count in the calculation it needs:<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A physical representation<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A tag<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A current AP larger than 0.<br>
						<br>
						Current AP starts off the same as the total AP for that type of armor.<br>
						When the armor takes damage, the current amount of AP it provides is reduced by the amount of damage taken.<br>
						If it is above 0 AP, it can be <a href="#RepairOptions">Repaired</a> back up to the total AP for that type of armor.
					</p>

					<p  class="clickable" onclick="toggleContent('CalcAP1')">
						In total, a player can benefit from a max of 140 of non-magical armor.<br>
						[Plate (20) x 7 locations]
					</p>
					<p>
						The Total Max AP a player can get is 146, due to the <a href="#ArmorRune">armor rune enchantment</a>.<br>
						(See <a href="#MagicArmor">Magical Armor</a>)<br>
					</p>
					<br><br>

					<p>
						Your <a href="#ArmorMove">Armor Move skill</a> will determine how much of that AP you can utilize.<br>
						The AP you can utilize is limited to the lowest of the following:<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Your <a href="#ArmorMove">Armor Move Skill</a> ranks x 5<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The current AP that you have equipped <br>
					</p>

					<p class="clickable unofficial" onclick="toggleContent('underArmorMove')">
						One weird interaction to note is what happens when you don&apos;t have enough AP to fully utilize an armor location.<br>
						In particular, if you wear armor larger than your Armor Move, your armor will break when you run out of AP, even if the armor would typically have AP left over.<br><br>

						As an example:<br>
						If you are wearing a plate armor location [20AP], and only have 1 rank in Armor Move [5 AP].
						That plate armor will break after it takes 5 damage.

			<h1 id="Combat">Combat</h1>

					Combat is the main purpose of Armor.  You can think of armor as a temporary pool of Body Points that might be replenish-able, depending on what happens.

				<h2 id="Damage">Taking damage</h2>
					<p>
						When you&apos;re hit by an attack, most of the time you&apos;ll take damage.  This is the number that gets called out by the other creature/player.
						That number then gets subtracted from your health pools, in the following order:
					</p>

					<p class="centered">MAP -&gt; AP -&gt; MAP* -&gt; MBP -&gt; BP</p>

					<p>
						MAP  = Magical Armor Points<br>

						MAP* = Magical Armor Points for <a href="#WindArmor">Wind Armor</a>, <a href="#DivineProtection">Divine Protection</a><br>
						MBP  = Magical Body Points<br>
						BP     = Body Points<br>
						<br>

						We&apos;ll go over the MAP and MAP* in the <a href="#MagicArmor">next section</a>.<br><br>
						Any “No-Armor” attack ignores MAP and AP and goes directly to MBP then BP, bypassing armor completely<br>
						[Exceptions: <a href="#IceMantle">Ice Mantle</a>, <a href="#WindArmor">Wind Armor</a>, <a href="#DivineProtection">Divine Protection</a>]<br><br>

						For armor in this guide, we&apos;re typically only concerned with the AP pool.  I'll provide some info on the Magical Armor Points just for refence. <br>
						Within the AP pool, there&apos;s a priority for how damage is distributed toyour different locations.<br><br>

						The location with the smallest AP takes damage first till it is exhausted, then the next smallest and so on.<br><br>
						<span class="unofficial">
						If all locations have the same AP and type, it's up to the player to decide which location takes damage first.
						</span><br><br>
					</p>
				</div>

				<h2 id="Example">Walking through an example:</h2>
					<p>
							I have 1 location of leather armor and 1 location of chain armor with enough armor move to utilize all of it. <br>
							That would have a total of AP 20 (5 leather and 15 chain). <br><br>

							I take a hit for 3 damage.<br>
							All 3 damage goes into the leather location, leaving it at 2 AP.   The chain location is at 15 AP. <br><br>

							I take another hit for 4 damage.<br>
							2 of that damage goes into the leather location, reducing it to 0.  The last 2 damage goes into the chain armor, leaving it at 13. <br><br>

							When the leather armor went to 0, it became broken.  This means it cannot be repaired without using a Mending Oil or via econ-based crafting.<br>
							(See <a href="#BrokeDestroy">Broken vs Destroyed</a>)<br><br>

							Since the chain location wasn&apos;t broken or destroyed, that chain armor can now be repaired by an Armorsmith out of combat.
							<br><br>

							It takes between 1-5 minutes to repair one AP, depending on how skilled the Armorsmith is.  (Level 1 translates to Novice, Level 5 translates to Master)<br><br>

							Continuing our example, a Master Armorsmith then repairs the armor by role playing out the fixing process for the next 2 minutes.  (A Novice would spend 10 minutes)<br><br>
					</p>
					<p class="unofficial">
						Not explicitly in the rules, it&apos;s considered good form to remove the armor so you can more effectively role play fixing it.
						I&apos;ve seen multiple armor smiths working on the same piece on field, to cooperatively minimize the time.  I don&apos;t know where that sits officially.
					</p>

				<h2 id="MagicArmor">Magical Armor</h2>

			<h1 id="Physreps">Physreps and you</h1>
				<p>
					The rule book does a pretty good job of providing information on what is acceptable.<br>
					<br>
					This is a very subjective area, as you&apos;ll need to get staff approval for any armor you&apos;re wearing  (for it to count as Armor.  You may wear what you like for Aesthetic purposes)<br>
					<br>
					The only area I have any experience in is Leather, and it&apos;s suggested to use 5-6 oz leather at a bare minimum.<br>
					<br>
					It&apos;s highly recommended to use 2 layers when constructing your armor, or use 10-12 oz leather.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					Due to the tag rules, you&apos;ll need to make sure every armor tag you have on your person has a physrep.  This includes broken armor you have from another player, or armor you&apos;re hoping to sell.<br>
					<br>
					For Broken Armor I suggest:<br>
				</p>
					<table class="CenteredTable">

				<p>For those of us who decide they want to participate in the crafting side of things, here&apos;s my thoughts on the rules that control crafting</p>

				<div class="h2_shift">
				<h2 id="OnField">On Field</h2>
					<p>
						The rules provided do a pretty good job of laying out all of the steps needed.  For an Armorsmith, it&apos;s recommended to have a small anvil (real or foam) to act as your crafting prop.<br>
						<br>
						When preparing to craft, make sure that you find a location you feel relatively safe at.  A place where there are people to converse with is a plus, as the 2 hour requirement is a long time.  I also suggest stocking up on drink and food, and using the restrooms.<br>
						<br>
						When you&apos;re ready to start, get the attention of a PM to let them know that you&apos;ll be crafting.<br>
						<br>
						After you&apos;re done crafting, let the GM shed know you&apos;ve completed.<br>
						(I was told to tell econ, to get the temp tag, but Econ directed me to the GM Shed)<br>
						<br>
						I recommend crafting the most expensive object you can (typically plate), as you&apos;re crafting only one item, regardless of the time it takes.
					</p>
				<h2 id="BetweenEvents">Between Events</h2>
					<p>
						Between events, you can craft either for yourself or for the King.<br>
						<br>
						If you craft for the King, you will make silver based on your level in the craft.<br>
						Level 1 = Novice<br>
						Level 5 = Master.<br>
						<br>
						If you craft for yourself, you can create any number of items that add up for the month.  You&apos;ll need to make sure you have enough coin in the bank, or have the materials when you pick up the tag, or your crafting will fail.<br>
						<br>
						You can craft and go on adventures at the same time.<br>
						<br>
						In either route, you use the Item Creation link on the Kanar website. And fill it out.  Next event, visit ECON to get your proper tag.  Don&apos;t forget your physrep!!<br>
						(Above is the link as of the date of this last update, if it doesn&apos;t work for you please make sure to use the KANAR.CLUB website)

					<h2 id="Champion">Champion</h2>
					<p>This subclass provides you with a free 10AP "helmet" every day.  You can't wear a helmet to get the benefit, and it won't protect you against knockouts.<br><br>

					It will refresh to 10AP in the morning.<br>
					<br>
					Since this is not a physical object, it doesn't interact with most of the armor rules. <br>
					So, I don't think it would be breakable, repairable, or destroyable.<br>

					<h2 id="Artisian">Artisian</h2>
					<p>This subclass allows you to craft faster on field, giving you access to double the amount of time.<br>
					For armorsmithing, the extra time option isn't as vital, as the highest you could craft is plate, and that takes 2 weeks.  <br>
					The extra item option is what we're interested in here.<br>
					<br>
					I'm unclear on if the double crafting means you need to craft for 4 hours instead of 2.

					<h2 id="Artificer">Artificer</h2>

					This is only available for armor that is represented by a physrep that covers more than one location.<br>

					That would mean the the chain armor shirt mentioned above would have an AP of 45-75. So it would be broken after taking 45 damage, instead of each location breaking after 15 damage.<br>

					<br>
					<br>
					The drawback would be that the entire thing would have to be repaired together, which would take longer before you could use parts of it.
					<br>
					<br>
					The rules around how enchanting is handled with the merging process still need to be worked out.<br>
					It's also unclear if you can merge different types of armor together, or if it has to be the same type.<br>
					<br>
					To merge your locations, you'll need to talk to the Econ staff on field.
